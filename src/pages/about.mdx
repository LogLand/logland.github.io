After graduating from Olds College's Horticulture program in 2019 I spent my first season of landscaping out in Vancouver where I developed a broad range of landscaping experience; basic maintenance to full renovations. While there I also volunteered with Vancouver's Stanley Park Ecology Society removing invasive species and public education about the park.

Returning to Calgary I held my first arborist job with the city's urban forestry division. Couple years into that I incorporated my own business and am now serving the surrounding area of Calgary, primarily focused on the small towns nearest the foothills but will drive out east into the plains, or west into the mountains if the job in question makes the commute practical.
