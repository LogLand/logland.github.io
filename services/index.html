<p>Climbing, Pruning, Removal, Planting, Disease &amp; Pest Management</p>
<p>Trees are my favourite &amp; my specialty. Whether you have just some branches resting on your roof, getting in the way of you cutting your lawn, or you have a young tree in need of some guidance; caring for trees and setting them up for long and healthy life is what I love most about my job.</p>
<h3 id="elms"><strong>Elms</strong></h3>
<p>Pruning Elms is prohibited in all western provinces except from about fall to spring. Alberta permitted October 1 to March 31, Saskatchewan September 1 - March 31, Manitoba August 1 - March 31. British Columbia, pruning ban unspecified but encouraged to be done during colder months.</p>
<h3 id="mayday-schubert-chokecherry-prunus-species"><strong>Mayday, Schubert Chokecherry (Prunus species)</strong></h3>
<p>These species are very susceptible to black knot fungal infections. Since it is a very prolific grower, to prevent infections of rubbing branches and to catch infections early, more regular pruning is beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="lilac"><strong>Lilac</strong></h3>
<p>Best pruned soon after flower blossoms have finished for the season, if pruned too late or in the fall next years flowers may not be as abundant the following year. If yours has grown to such a size that more drastic pruning is called for, this can be done any time as it will usually take a couple years for new shoots growing from pruned mature stems to produce blossoms.</p>
<h3 id="cotoneaster"><strong>Cotoneaster</strong></h3>
<p>Mature hedges are prone to infestations of oystershell scale insects. If caught early enough infested branches can be pruned out, but quite often it is a better idea idea to cut the whole hedge to the ground and let the plant start fresh. I prefer to do this as early in the season as possible to let the shrubs rebound as much as possible before winter.</p>
<p>Infested shrubs can also pose a health risk to nearby Apple and Hawthorn trees which can also fall victim to the insect, all three being of the Rosaceae family.</p>
<h2 id="gardening">Gardening</h2>
<p>Garden Beds, Landscape Renovations</p>
<p>If your garden bed needs more than a little weeding and could use a deep cleaning I’m quite happy to spend a day polishing it up. Once a year or every few years type of tasks, like setting a fresh edge around the border of your lawn, or leveling uneven paving stones in your walkway, I enjoy doing too.</p>
<p>Got some unused space you’d like to bring some life to? I’d be happy to install a new garden bed for you. I’m also able to do land clearing of larger areas in rural regions, and tidying up shelter belts or planting new ones.</p>
<h2 id="subcontracting">Subcontracting</h2>
<p>If your own company needs some extra help doing some of these or other related tasks I have subcontracted before and am very open to partnering with other companies who need a tree climber or landscaper.</p></div></div></article><div id="right-tree"><div></div></div></main> <footer data-astro-transition-persist="astro-7s5ueou2-1"> <nav><div class="button-container"><button class="nav-button" id="nav-button-0"><a class="nav-text" href="/">Home</a></button></div><div class="button-container"><button class="nav-button" id="nav-button-1"><a class="nav-text" href="/services">Services</a></button></div><div class="button-container"><button class="nav-button" id="nav-button-2"><a class="nav-text" href="/about">About</a></button></div><div class="button-container"><button class="nav-button" id="nav-button-3"><a class="nav-text" href="/contact">Contact</a></button></div></nav> </footer> </body></html>
