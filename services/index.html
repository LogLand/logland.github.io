<p>Pruning, Removal, Planting, Disease &amp; Pest Management</p>
<p>Trees are my favorite &amp; my specialty. Whether you have just some branches resting on your roof, getting in the way of you cutting your lawn, you have a young tree in need of some guidance; caring for trees and setting them up for long and healthy life is what I love most about my job.</p>
<h3 id="elms"><strong>Elms</strong></h3>
<p>British Columbia, pruning ban unspecified. Alberta, October 1 to March 31. Saskatchewan, September 1 - March 31. Manitoba, August 1 - March 31.</p>
<h3 id="mayday-schubert-chokecherry-prunus-species"><strong>Mayday, Schubert Chokecherry (Prunus species)</strong></h3>
<p>Very susceptible to black knot fungal infections, these species benefit from regular more regular pruning to prevent infections of rubbing branches and to catch infections early.</p>
<h3 id="lilac"><strong>Lilac</strong></h3>
<p>Best pruned soon after flower blossoms have finished for the season, if pruned too late or in the fall next years flowers may not be as abundant the following year. If yours has grown to such a size that more drastic pruning is called for this can be done any time.</p>
<h3 id="cotoneaster"><strong>Cotoneaster</strong></h3>
<p>Mature hedges are prone to infestations of oystershell scale insects. If caught early enough infested branches can be pruned out, but quite often it is just a better idea idea to cut the whole hedge to the ground and let the plant start fresh. I prefer to do this as early in the season as possible to let the shrubs rebound as much as possible before winter.</p>
<p>Infested shrubs can also pose a health risk to nearby apple and hawthorn trees who can also fall victim it, all three being of the Rosaceae family.</p>
<h2 id="gardening">Gardening</h2>
<p>Garden Beds, Landscape Renovations</p>
<p>If your garden bed needs more than a little weeding and could use a deep cleaning I’m quite happy to spend a day polishing it up. Other once year or every other year type tasks too, like setting a fresh edge around the border of your lawn, or leveling uneven paving stones in your walkway.</p>
<p>Got some unused space you’d like to bring some life to? I’d be happy to install a new garden bed for you.</p>
<p>Land clearing of larger areas in rural regions, shelter belts needing attention, I love driving out to remote areas (sure beats rush hour in the city).</p>
<h2 id="subcontracting">Subcontracting</h2>
<p>I’m also very open to partnering with other companies who need a tree climber, or just some extra help doing whatever needs to get done.</p></div></div></article><div id="right-tree"><div></div></div></main> <footer data-astro-transition-persist="astro-7s5ueou2-1"> <nav><div class="button-container"><button class="nav-button" id="nav-button-0"><a class="nav-text" href="/">Home</a></button></div><div class="button-container"><button class="nav-button" id="nav-button-1"><a class="nav-text" href="/services">Services</a></button></div><div class="button-container"><button class="nav-button" id="nav-button-2"><a class="nav-text" href="/about">About</a></button></div><div class="button-container"><button class="nav-button" id="nav-button-3"><a class="nav-text" href="/contact">Contact</a></button></div></nav> </footer> </body></html>
